- Theme
    Smart Education

- Problem Description

Despite the rising urgency of climate change and environmental degradation, environmental education remains largely theoretical in many Indian schools and colleges. Students are often taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological issues, or personal responsibility.

There is a lack of engaging tools that motivate students to adopt eco-friendly practices or understand the direct consequences of their lifestyle choices. Traditional methods fail to instill sustainable habits or inspire youth participation in local environmental efforts.

- Impact

As future decision-makers, students must be environmentally literate and empowered to take meaningful actions. Without innovative education methods, we risk raising a generation unaware of sustainability challenges.

An interactive, practical approach to environmental learning will foster long-term behavioral change, local involvement, and a ripple effect across families and communities. This aligns with India's SDG goals and NEP 2020's emphasis on experiential learning.

- Expected Outcomes

• A gamified mobile/web platform or app that teaches students about environmental issues through interactive lessons, challenges, quizzes, and real-world tasks (e.g., tree-planting, waste segregation).
• Tracking of eco-points, enabling school-level competitions.
• Rewards for sustainable practices through digital badges and recognition.

- Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• School and college students
• Teachers and eco-club coordinators
• Environmental NGOs and government departments

- Supporting Data

• UNESCO reports that experiential, gamified learning increases student retention and engagement by over 70%.
• NEP 2020 encourages integration of environmental awareness into the curriculum.

# 📅 **SIH25028 – Smart Timetable Maker** 

### **0. Details on Website.**

- Theme
    Smart Education

- Background

Higher Education institutions often face challenges in efficient class scheduling due to limited infrastructure, faculty constraints, elective courses, and overlapping departmental requirements. Manual timetable preparation leads to frequent clashes in classes, underutilized classrooms, uneven workload distribution, and dissatisfied students and faculty members. With the increasing adoption of multidisciplinary curricula and flexible learning under NEP 2020, the class scheduling process has become more complex and dynamic, requiring intelligent and adaptive solutions.

- Description

The current scheduling mechanism in most higher education institutes/colleges relies on manual input via spreadsheets or basic tools. These fail to account for real-time availability of faculty, room capacity, teaching load norms, subject combinations, and student preferences. A solution is required that will accommodate the various parameters required for scheduling classes for UG and PG students and return an optimized timetable ensuring:
• Maximized utilization of classrooms and laboratories
• Minimized workload on faculty members and students
• Achievement of required learning outcomes

- Key Parameters

The following parameters can be taken into account as variables for creating optimized timetables:
- Number of classrooms available
- Number of batches of students
- Number of subjects to be taught in a particular semester
- Names of subjects
- Maximum number of classes per day
- Number of classes to be conducted for a subject per week / per day
- Number of faculties available for different subjects
- Average number of leaves a faculty member takes in a month
- Special classes that have fixed slots in timetable

- Students may also consider additional variables that may help in effective timetable preparation.

- Expected Solution

A web-based platform that can be linked to the college website. Authorized personnel will be able to login and input data against the listed variables to generate fully optimized timetables.

- The platform should include:
• Login facility for authorized personnel to create and manage timetables
• Multiple options of optimized timetables to choose from
• Review and approval workflow for competent authorities
• Suggestions for suitable rearrangements when optimal solutions are not available
• Support for multi-department and multi-shift scheduling

---
